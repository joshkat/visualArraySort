# Array Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! 
This app allows you to see how different sorting algorithms work in action and understand how they compare to each other. 
You can choose from a variety of different algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, and radix sort.

Not only is it fascinating to see how the algorithms work and how they compare in terms of speed and efficiency, 
but understanding how sorting algorithms work is also important for understanding how computers work and how we 
can make them more efficient. Plus, it's just plain fun to watch the algorithms in action and see how they rearrange the numbers!

Using the input area at the top of the screen, you can adjust the sorting speed dynamically as the algorithm is running. 
The default speed is 100ms per swap, but you can adjust this to your liking mid sort to either slow down or speed up the algorithim that's runnning.
